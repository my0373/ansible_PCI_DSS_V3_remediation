## So normally I would set this to
## - hosts: all
## However I only want to run this on this foreman group
- hosts:  foreman_hostgroup_rhel7
  remote_user: ansible
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:

  ## Update security patches only. This works for RHEL7, RHEL6 requires an extra package to be installed.
  ## It's on the TODO:Add switch for RHEL6 that installs extra package.
    - name: Update security patches only
      command: yum update-minimal --security -y

    - name: Force satellite to update its patch records
      command: katello-package-upload
